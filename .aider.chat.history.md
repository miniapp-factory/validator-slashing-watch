App Name: Validator Slashing Watch

Description:
Validator Slashing Watch is a Mini App that monitors staking validators across multiple blockchain networks to detect slashing risks and incidents in real time. Get instant alerts when a validator shows signs of instability, downtime, or behavior that could lead to slashing, helping users protect their staked assets.

Key Features:
 • Real-time monitoring of validator performance and uptime
 • Instant alerts for slashing events or high-risk indicators
 • Tracking across multiple PoS networks
 • Historical slashing data and validator health trends
 • Dashboard to compare validator stability and risk levels

Use Case:
Perfect for stakers and delegators who want to minimize risks, choose reliable validators, and protect their assets from slashing penalties.

A modern flat design logo featuring a shield with a stylized validator icon (a checkmark inside a circle) and interconnected network nodes radiating outward. The color palette uses gradients of blue and green to convey security and blockchain connectivity, with a subtle shadow for depth.
